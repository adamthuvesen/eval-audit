## Audit Summary

### Claim `hold_pattern`

- **Verdict:** `hold` — Treatment differs from control significantly, but in the OPPOSITE direction of the claim. The data falsifies the claim's stated direction rather than confirming it. Action: hold the current selection; this evidence does not warrant a switch.
- **Claim status:** unsupported
- **Why:** delta -70.00 pp with bootstrap CI [-100.00 pp, -40.00 pp] over 10 paired tasks; treatment is 0.40x the control's cost
- **What would change it:** ~350 more paired tasks would tighten the CI to ≤ MDE (estimated, variance-fixed scaling)
- **Reviewer pushback:** none flagged at this stage

### Claim `rerun_more_n_pattern`

- **Verdict:** `rerun_more_n` — The bootstrap CI for the delta crosses zero (no decisive direction), and the cost gap is below the material threshold of 10% of the cheaper arm. Neither side has a clean argument from this evidence. Action: collect more paired tasks before deciding; the current N is under-resolved for the question asked.
- **Claim status:** inconclusive
- **Why:** delta +10.00 pp with bootstrap CI [-30.00 pp, +50.00 pp] over 10 paired tasks; treatment is 0.94x the control's cost
- **What would change it:** ~630 more paired tasks would tighten the CI to ≤ MDE (estimated, variance-fixed scaling)
- **Reviewer pushback:** none flagged at this stage

### Claim `inconclusive_no_action_pattern`

- **Verdict:** `inconclusive_no_action` — The bootstrap CI for the delta is one-sided (does not cross zero), but the correction-adjusted p-value does not reject at α — the audit's declared inference contract requires a significant correction-adjusted test before claiming direction. No dominance or cost-gap rule fires. Action: keep the current selection until additional evidence (more N to tighten the test, or cost data that triggers the cost-gap rule) shifts the picture.
- **Claim status:** inconclusive
- **Why:** delta +40.00 pp with bootstrap CI [+10.00 pp, +70.00 pp] over 10 paired tasks; treatment is 0.67x the control's cost
- **What would change it:** ~350 more paired tasks would tighten the CI to ≤ MDE (estimated, variance-fixed scaling)
- **Reviewer pushback:** none flagged at this stage

## Study

- **id:** `decision-gallery`
- **benchmark:** `decision-gallery`
- **harness:** `decision-gallery`
- **analysis_mode:** `declared_reanalysis`
- **data_observation:** `full_seen`
- **claim:** Synthetic claim targeting the `hold` verdict. The claim asserts hold_treatment beats hold_control on success_rate. The data is constructed so the paired t-test rejects the null at α=0.05 AND the observed direction is opposite the claim — treatment significantly underperforms control. hold_treatment is cheaper than hold_control so it is not Pareto-dominated, which is what lets the engine reach the `hold` rule branch instead of `drop_from_shortlist`.

**MDE context**

- `hold_pattern`: bootstrap CI half-width = 30.00 pp vs target_mde = 5.00 pp — the study has resolution coarser than the declared MDE; an effect at the declared MDE would not be reliably detected without more data.
- `rerun_more_n_pattern`: bootstrap CI half-width = 40.00 pp vs target_mde = 5.00 pp — the study has resolution coarser than the declared MDE; an effect at the declared MDE would not be reliably detected without more data.
- `inconclusive_no_action_pattern`: bootstrap CI half-width = 30.00 pp vs target_mde = 5.00 pp — the study has resolution coarser than the declared MDE; an effect at the declared MDE would not be reliably detected without more data.

## Cost-quality view

**Pareto frontier (max success_rate, min total_cost_usd):** ['hold_control', 'hold_treatment', 'inconc_treatment', 'rerun_treatment']

Dominated agents: ['inconc_control', 'rerun_control']. Each is dominated by another agent that achieves at least the same success_rate at no greater total_cost_usd.
